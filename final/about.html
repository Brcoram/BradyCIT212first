    <p>
In 2001, former baseball player and coach, Paul Butcher saw a need for better, custom, more durable gloves for his players.  He started crafting leather goods as a hobby but saw an opportunity to blend his hobby and his love of the game.  After making some prototypes for his team, he started being asked to make gloves for other teams and a business was born.  Paul rented a small warehouse space and hired a team of experienced craftsmen to bring his vision to life.
    </p>
    <p>
In the last 20 years, Orbit has grown from that small warehouse to a team of more than 100 American workers.  Growing from high school teams in the midwest, Orbit has expanded it's reach to colleges nationwide and eventually caught the eye of All-star Shortstop Javier Baez.  As soon as Javy Baez flashed is skills on the diamond with an Orbit glove, our products exploded onto the professional landscape.
